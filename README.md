# Book Catalog Microservice (Minimal API)

This project is a simple cloud-native REST microservice built with ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs.  
It manages a catalog of books with full CRUD operations over an in-memory list.  
Endpoints include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE with proper status codes (200, 201, 204, 404, 400).  

## How to Run
1. Open the folder in VS Code.
2. Run the API with:
   ```bash
   dotnet run

## How To Test
Use test.http with the REST Client extension in VS Code.
Click "Send Request" above each section to verify all endpoints.
